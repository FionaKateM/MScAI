what
if
i
dont
get
anything
Statistics
and
understanding
when
to
use
which
thing
Level
of
technical
knowledge
required
Having
a
lack
of
knowledge
in
statistics
might
make
it
harder
for
me
to
grasp
some
concepts
programming
expertise

but
would
be
happy
to
learn
more
programming
Statistics
and
numbers
Programming
and
coding
is
something
I
really
want
to
know
because
it
is
not
easy
but
I
want
to
know
None
Effective
way
to
deal
with
big
data
it
is
a
new
subject
and
I
do
not
know
what
to
expect

To
be
able
to
cope
up
with
the
speed
of
learning
New
subject
No
concerns
as
such
currently
No
previous
knowledge
of
programming
The
statistics
Not
being
able
to
keep
up
with
my
peers
due
to
lack
of
coding
experience
my
greatest
concerns
have
to
do
with
how
am
going
abreast
myself
with
all
the
various
coding
tools
It
may
be
more
complex
than
I
think
it
is
Its
been
a
while
that
I
have
studied
stats
and
whether
I
will
able
to
use
it
with
R
Lack
of
hands
on
experience
especially
with
a
modern
tech
stack
How
to
connect
the
theory
part
with
the
lab
section
This
course
should
follow
real
life
examples
and
practices
with
guidance
in
mind
The
fact
that
I
have
little
understanding
in
programming
Translating
my
thought
processes
and
understandings
into
results
I
am
concern
about
scope
of
the
syllabus
I
want
to
learn
about
Microsoft
Azure
Amazon
web
services
and
Google
cloud
as
data
science
and
data
engineering
point
of
view
At
this
moment
I
dont
know
how
much
depth
will
be
provided
in
syllabus
Gaining
Skills
to
proceed
with
my
career
in
the
right
path
My
inability
to
effectively
code
Less
time
for
practice
Bit
of
Programming
but
happy
to
learn

Is
to
know
how
to
write
complex
codes
validate
them
and
gives
a
meaningful
interpretation
based
on
the
results
output
Tasks
and
assignments
I
am
currently
still
in
my
home
country
I
might
miss
out
on
some
classes
because
I
havent
yet
received
my
Visa
learning
R
compared
to
Python
Real
time
applications
Statistics
Nothing
Mostly
the
programming
but
super
excited
to
learn
Programming
NA
Statistics
So
far
none
None
That
it
wont
be
enough
to
gain
skills
for
employment
The
fact
that
were
using
R
and
not
Python
Assessment
Coding
as
I
never
did
complex
coding
of
applications
Programming
Having
no
basis
in
the
use
of
programming
software
Using
R
over
Python
especially
for
Machine
learning
Accent
Please
reduce
the
accent
and
speak
little
bit
louder
during
the
sesions
Coding
Not
enough
feedback
for
the
labs
and
the
answers
Nothing
as
of
now
which
programming
language
to
use
Difficulty
level
Difficulties
in
understanding
some
concepts
which
Im
not
familiar
with
Learn
new
ideas
and
things
